QDOS is a test automation framework developed on top of Selenium API. It is used to automate testing for websites on browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, phantomJS etc. To use and integrate this framework, no major technical skills needed i.e no programming knowledge required on any any of the language like Java, C#, .Net, Ruby etc.

# What it does?
QDOS Framework automates testing for websites on market standard internet browsers. Main idea of this framework is to eliminate the technical skills required to automate any website on market standard browsers, which also means that any Manual Tester can use this framework and automate the testing of their website. 

> "Manual Tester can be converted to Automation Tester via QDOS - framework."

Since Manual Testers can be converted to Automation Tester, this framework can help many organisation to save cost around testing and can help Manual testers who can earn the wages of Automation Tester.

# How it does?
In order to automate testing via QDOS, a tester must know about how to use this framework first (Please read the "Getting Started" Wiki Page) and write Microsoft Excel Sheet which will contains list of test cases which will be executed by QDOS framework on requested browser.

QDOS Framework is very simple and easy to configure. A tester only need to write test cases in Microsoft Excel Sheet and upload the Excel Sheet (which is called as _"Test Suite"_) to [QDOS Console](http://qdos.systematictesting.com). Once uploaded in QDOS Console, tester have to run QDOS Client on their local system and fill out the details of Test Suite which they want to execute. That't it - Rest will be handled by QDOS Framework. 

Tester will notice that Uploaded Test Suite is running on their local system and live report is published on QDOS Console.
